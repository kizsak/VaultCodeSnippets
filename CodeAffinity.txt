<p>You arrive at the old garden just as the sun dips below the stone walls. Two figures stand nearby: Alex, pruning roses with quiet focus, and Morgan, seated beneath a tree sketching in a tattered notebook.

<p>Alex glances up. “You’re just in time. The moonflowers bloom at dusk.”

::GardenAgain
(if: $metAlex is true and $metMorgan is true)[
<p>You stand again at the crossroads of green shadows. The roses rustle softly, and pencil scratches echo faintly from the tree. You have spoken with both Alex and Morgan — and the choice, now, is yours.</p>

(else-if: $metAlex is true and $metMorgan is false)[
<p>You linger near the trimmed rosebeds. Alex’s shears are silent, waiting. The tree beyond still hides the figure you haven’t yet met.</p>

<p>Morgan watches you from the shade. You sense curiosity there — and somewhere among the roses, someone else waits.</p>

<p>You're alone in the garden, paths unworn. Two presences wait unseen: one among the roses, the other beneath a tree’s canopy. Which will you choose?</p>

::MeetMorgan

<p>“The moonflowers only open when it’s quiet. They dislike drama.” Alex side-eyes the direction of Morgan’s tree.

::MorganSit

<p>You sit together, not speaking. Morgan’s pencil moves. “I draw what people don’t say.”

<p>Morgan finally looks at you. “You see the shapes in the branches too, don’t you?”
