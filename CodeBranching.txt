<p>You are completing an online application for a new job.
**APPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT IN THE DEPARTMENT OF VAGUELY DEFINED RESPONSIBILITIES.**
<span class="glow-demo">How do you prefer to handle abstract problems?</span>
</style>
* [[I delegate them to abstract subordinates.|Q2Delegate]]
* [[I file them under 'pending metaphysics.'|Q2Pending]]
* [[I eat them. Problems are delicious.|Q2Eat]]

</style>
<p>The form nods. A second question appears, written in gold ink:
<span class="gold-text">Your subordinates have unionized. How do you proceed?</span>
* [[Negotiate with snacks and interpretive dance.|Q3Snacks]]
* [[Fire everyone and promote your coffee mug.|Q3Mug]]


::Q2Pending

  -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(50, 50, 50, 0.2);
}
</style>
<p>The next question is not a question:
<span="silver-text">Metaphysics is backlogged. You have been reassigned to Emotional Tax Accounting. First client: a cloud that regrets raining.</span>
* [[Offer condolences and an umbrella.|Q3Umbrella]]
* [[Redirect it to Grievance Weather.|Q3Redirect]]

<p>Delicious. The question tastes like regret and cinnamon. Another question glows:
<span class="glow-demo">You now feel all unresolved problems within a 2-mile radius. This includes pigeons.</span>
