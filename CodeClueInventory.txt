<p>You are cataloguing the contents of the decaying library at Ashwood Estate. You find a hidden ledger containing encrypted confessions of a long-forgotten crime. You cannot yet piece together what the crime was, but it is clear that there is more information in a locked archive. You decide to search the estate for other clues. [[You start in the entrance hall.|EntranceHall]]</p>

::DrawingRoom
(set: $cluePhoto to true)

<p>The scent of ash clings to the velvet drapes of the Drawing Room. On the mantle lies a photo, edges burned, but a single phrase scrawled on the back catches your eye: *"Forgive the fire. She only wanted truth."*

Take the photo and return to the [[Entrance Hall.|EntranceHall]]</p>


::ServantsQuarters
(set: $clueServants to true)

<p>You step over shattered crockery. In the shadows, something speaks—not a voice, but a memory. "You shouldn't have opened the archive," someone whispers from a bed that hasn't been slept in for decades.</p>

[[Return to the entrance hall.|EntranceHall]]


::Clocktower
(set: $clueClock to true)

<p>You climb the rickety stairs to the broken clocktower. Nestled behind the gears is a brittle **page torn from a journal**, dated the night of the fire. It ends mid-sentence: *"He knows about the cellar..."*</p>

[[Return to the entrance hall.|EntranceHall]]


::Conservatory
(set: $clueMedallion to true)

<p>A cracked glass case stands among the overgrowth. Inside, you find a small silver **medallion**, tarnished but unmistakably engraved with the Ashwood crest.</p>

[[Return to entrance hall.|EntranceHall]]


::ArchiveInterior
The archive hums with secrets. On the desk, the ledger awaits—its final page still damp with ink.

**You have uncovered the truth. But will you share it?**

::Study
(set: $clueFingerprints to true)
<p>The desk is layered in dust, but a drawer has been recently disturbed. Inside: a black inkwell—and a half-smudged **fingerprint** on its rim.</p>
