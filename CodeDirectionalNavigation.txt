You focus your gaze forward. The city rises in layers: domed towers, filament bridges, veins of light crawling up buildings like ivy. From somewhere, beneath all that steel and silence, you feel like someone—something?—watching you.

The perspective shifts right. The rising sun glints off the shattered remains of something ancient—pillars half-sunk into the ground, like ribs of a buried beast. Golden light catches on metal shards strewn like salt.

(replace: ?viewHook)[
            You turn around. The desert stretches out in perfect stillness, the trail you carved now almost invisible. Wind brushes over the sand, wiping away the memory of your passage.

              (replace: ?viewHook)[
                You pivot to the left. Your view tightens on a dilapidated structure nestled just outside the city's edge. Antennae bristle from its roof like quills. For a moment, it feels more familiar than the city itself.
