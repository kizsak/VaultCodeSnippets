::ArchivalNotes
<p>You are a researcher exploring a fragmented digital journal from an ill-fated expedition to an ancient site known as Site Thalos. As you explore the journal, you can access embedded archive passages (highlighted or footnoted) that reveal deeper information: personal notes, scientific footnotes, or corrupted logs.

The heat at Site Thalos was unrelenting. Even in the shadows of the obelisks, (link: "sweat pooled beneath the harness straps")[(display: "Archive1")]. Dr. Valencia remained convinced we were close to uncovering the central vault â€” a theory based on a (link: "fragmented map found beneath Layer Delta")[(display: "MapNote1")].

<p>A faint tremor woke us around 03:14. At first, we thought it was wind shifting the dunes again. But then came the humming.

<p>We descended into the lower gallery this morning. The walls bore carvings unseen in any previous survey â€” glyphs spiraling inward like some kind of [[gravitational diagram|GlyphNote]].  

The temperature dropped sharply. Valencia remarked it was (link: "unnaturally cold")[(display: "ColdNote")], like something was drawing heat out of the air.

<p>Valencia insisted on pressing further in. I stayed behind to catalog our readings. Thatâ€™s when I noticed a hum â€” not audible, but (link: "inside the bones")[(display: "BoneNote")].  

I reached out to touch the carved wall, and it felt like it was breathing.

<p>Dr. Valencia hasnâ€™t returned. The radio is silent, but I found her notebook. The final page is just one word, written over and over:

<p>ðŸ§ª**Dr. Valenciaâ€™s Log - Entry 88**  
//Third hum event recorded. Timestamp: 03:14. All sensors aligned. Vibration synchronized with a spike in geothermal readings. This is no coincidence.'//

::BoneNote

Subdermal vibration detected. Origin point traced to central chamber wall. Subjectâ€™s heart rate increased by 18 bpm. No external vibration detected.

The map, inked on animal hide and partially carbonized, suggests a concentric chamber structure â€” a feature consistent with early containment architecture in Thalosian ruins.

Circular inscriptions traced into obsidian. The pattern appears mathematical â€” Fibonacci spirals or analogues.
