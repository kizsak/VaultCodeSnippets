Welcome to //INST388Q Interactive Fiction//! The entire course will take place in this game, where you will play out a piece of interactive fiction that is half story-game and half instructional material. You will work through content on the history and theory of interactive fiction, narrative structures as they relate to interactive fiction, narrative genres within the context of interactive fiction, interactive fiction design theory, use of Twine, Harlowe markup language, and some basic CSS/HTML coding.

While most of the story is happening within Twine, you will see //some// links to external sources. These links include published Twine games I have selected for you, externally developed puzzles and games, and links to ELMS assignments to submit your work. When you submit an assignment on ELMS, you will receive feedback from me and a four-digit code. You will enter this code into a user input box, and you will be allowed to continue in the game. There are five assignments.

Are you BRAND NEW to interactive fiction or specifically to hypertext fiction? Here's a [[quick explanation.|BeginnersGuide]]

When you see text that looks like this, it is a message from the gamerunner‚Äîme‚Äîto the player‚Äîyou. It exists outside the narrative.</p>
</div>

<p>When you see text like this, it means there is a term on the page defined in the <span class="glossary-link">(link: "glossary.")[(display: "Def:Glossary")]</span>
</p>

<div class="variable-display">
When you see text that looks like this, it indicates the state of your global variable counts: Analysis, Empathy, Exploration, Foresight, and Imagination. You will accrue points in these values based on the choices you make during the first third of the story, at which point, your variable counts will determine a set of 3 narrative structures and a set of 3 fiction genres that you will study in more depth. Options of fiction genres will include:
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Action and Adventure 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Humor and Satire 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Mystery, Thriller, and Crime 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Philosophical 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Realistic 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Romance and Relationship 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Speculative 

Options of narrative structures will include:
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Cascade 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Hub-and-Spoke 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Open Map 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Puzzle-Based 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Recursive 
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Triggered Progression 

An example of a potential match: a player whose top value is imagination will have the chance to study speculative fiction‚Äîand its unique place amongst interactive fiction genres. A player whose top value is analysis will have the chance to study puzzle-based narratives. Players will be restricted to these options for two assignments; one is a 10-15<span class="glossary-link"> (link: "passage")[(display: "Def:Passage")]</span>Twine story and the other is a 20-25 passage Twine story. For your final project--a Twine story of your own design of at least 50 passages--you may work without restrictions.

<img src="https://github.com/kizsak/VaultImages/raw/main/FullGlossary.png">
<p>You can also view the [[full glossary|FullGlossary]] at any time‚Äîthere is a link in the footer panel of every passage.

<img src="https://github.com/kizsak/VaultImages/raw/main/FooterPanel.png" alt="Screenshot of the game's footer panel">
<p>The text above is in your footer panel--it will show up on MOST (80-90%) of the pages in the story; there are just a few where I withheld that feature to support the design of certain passages. You can save your game at any time--click (link: "Save Game")[(save-game: "quicksave")]. You will know it worked if the link to save the game disappears from the footer panel. When you return to the game--you can start again [[at the first passage|START]]. Click (link: "Load Game")[(load-game: "quicksave")] on the start passage and it will return you to your saved place in the game. </p>

<div class="player-message">
A last word before you begin? Here are some things to expect in this story:
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> The narrative will unfold in fragments, often giving you multiple paths.
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Your decisions affect what you see, discover, and unlock.
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Some passages may include puzzles, interactive systems, or even hidden mechanics.
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> You may see your traits or variables change as you play‚Äîreflecting how your choices shape your character.
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> There‚Äôs no single ‚Äúright‚Äù path. Interactive fiction is about exploration and discovery.
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Try clicking every link; sometimes they reveal more than one layer of the story.
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Don‚Äôt be afraid to backtrack or replay‚Äîinteractive fiction is built for multiple runs.
<span style="color: orange;">‚ú¶</span> Pay attention to words, symbols, or mechanics that reappear; they often hint at deeper story connections.

And finally, enjoy the blend of reading and playing‚Äîthink of it as part novel, part game, part instruction manual, and part teaching and learning experiment!
