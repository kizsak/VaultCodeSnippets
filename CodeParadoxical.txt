::Wake
(set: $tries to 0)
(set: $mirrorBroken to false)
(set: $voiceHeard to false)

<p>You wake up in a white chamber with no memory of how you got here. The light hums. The air feels heavy with meaning.

[[Look around|Room]]</p>


::Room
<p>You see a mirror that doesn’t reflect properly, and a door with no handle. Your breath fogs neither.

[[Inspect the door|InspectDoor]]
[[Look into the mirror|InspectMirror]]
[[Say something aloud|SpeakAloud]]</p>


::InspectDoor
<p>You push on the door. It doesn’t budge. But as you step away, you hear a soft click behind you.

[[Turn around|Room]]</p>


::InspectMirror
<p>The mirror reflects the room but not you. Instead, it shows you looking at yourself, but slightly delayed.

[[Touch the mirror|LoopedChoice1]]
[[Smash the mirror|BreakMirror]]
[[Back away|Room]]</p>


::SpeakAloud
(set: $voiceHeard to true)
<p>You say your name. The mirror says something different back.
“That’s not who you are now,” it whispers.</p>

[[Keep talking->LoopedChoice2]]
[[Back away->Room]]</p>


::LoopedChoice1
(set: $tries to $tries + 1)
<p>When you touch the mirror, you appear inside it. A reflection of yourself now looks out at you and makes the same gesture — but opposite.

(if: $tries is 1)[It’s unsettling.]
(else-if: $tries is 2)[Your reflection now smiles. You didn’t.]
(else-if: $tries is 3)[It doesn’t move anymore. You’ve lost control of it.]
(else:)[The reflection reaches out — and pulls you in.]

(if: $tries < 4)[
[[Touch it again|LoopedChoice1]]
[[Try something else|Room]]
]
(else:)[
[[Fall forward|Escape]]
]</p>


::LoopedChoice2
<p>You talk about yourself. The voice begins interrupting. “That’s not true,” it says. “You remember more than you admit.”

[[Deny it|LoopedChoice2]]
[[Agree|LoopedChoice3]]</p>


::LoopedChoice3
<p>“That’s not true,” the voice says again. “Then why are you still here?”

(if: $voiceHeard is true)[
You remember the mirror. The way it smiled when you didn’t.
[[Say: ‘I surrender.’|Surrender]]
]
[[Say: ‘I want to leave.’|LoopedChoice3]]</p>


::BreakMirror
(if: $mirrorBroken is false)[
<p>You throw a chair through the mirror. It shatters. Behind it: nothing. A wall. But now your reflection appears everywhere else — on the floor, the door, the ceiling.
(set: $mirrorBroken to true)
[[Back|Room]]
]
(else:)[
The mirror is already broken. Your reflection no longer changes. It just stares.
[[Back|Room]]
]</p>


::Surrender
<p>The chamber dims. The door opens. You never hear the voice again.</p>

[[Step through.|Escape]]


::Escape
<p>You are outside. The world is wrong — but it’s yours again. The paradox is broken.

''THE END''</p>
