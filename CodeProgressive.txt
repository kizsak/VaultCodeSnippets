<p>A storm splits the mountain above. You and your team descend into the rift, seeking the relic lost beneath centuries of ash. But when the rope snaps, you fall alone.

[[Check your gear.|GearCheck]]
[[Call out for help.|Echoes]]


::GearCheck
<p>You pat your belt. Most of your tools are gone — except a lighter and some soaked rations. You find an old torch near a stone outcrop.

[[Light the torch.|TorchLit]]
[[Leave it and keep going.|RiftFork]]</p>


::TorchLit
(set: $hasTorch to true)
<p>You light the torch. Shadows recoil. You move forward, warmth flickering across walls marked with strange symbols.

[[Continue into the rift.|RiftFork]]</p>


::RiftFork
<p>You reach a fork: one tunnel glows faintly green, the other drops into a tight vertical shaft.

[[Take the glowing path.|GlowingPath]]
[[Climb into the shaft.|VerticalShaft]]</p>


::VerticalShaft
(set: $pathTaken to "shaft")
<p>You lower yourself down. It’s slick. Near the bottom, you slip.

(if: $hasTorch is false)[
(set: $legInjured to true)
You fall hard. Your leg twists painfully.

[[Stumble on.|ChamberEntrance]]</p>


::GlowingPath
(set: $pathTaken to "glow")
(set: $artifactFound to true)
<p>The glow comes from bioluminescent moss — and a shape beneath it. A fossilized pack. Inside: dried notes, and a ceramic artifact.

[[Continue forward.|ChamberEntrance]]</p>


::ChamberEntrance
<p>The tunnel opens into a vault. Vines dangle from the ceiling. You hear rhythmic breathing. Something huge slumbers here.

(if: $artifactFound)[You grip the ceramic artifact — it hums slightly.]
(if: $legInjured)[Your limp slows you. Every sound feels louder.]
(if: $hasTorch)[The torchlight flickers over the stone, casting a brief gleam across scales.]

[[Sneak around the chamber.|Sneak]]
[[Approach the sleeping beast.|Beast]]
[[Retreat quietly.|ExitTunnel]]</p>


::Beast
(set: $beastAwake to true)
<p>The beast's eye opens. It rises. A hundred tons of ancient fury. It sees you.

(if: $artifactFound)[The artifact pulses. You raise it instinctively. The beast halts.]
(else:)[It lunges.]

[[Try to run.|ExitTunnel]]
[[Stand your ground.|Altar]]</p>


::Altar
(if: $artifactFound)[
<p>You place the artifact in a hollow socket. The beast stops. A deep tone resonates through the chamber.

**ENDING: Guardian’s Accord**
]
(else:)[
You reach the altar, but there's nothing to offer. The beast does not hesitate.

::Sneak
(if: $legInjured)[
(set: $beastAwake to true)
<p>Your foot catches on a vine. The beast stirs.
]
(else:)[You step quietly, hugging the wall.]

[[Reach the altar.|Altar]]


::ExitTunnel
(if: $beastAwake)[
<p>You flee. The tunnel collapses behind you. You survive, barely, but the relic is lost.

You escape undetected. No treasure, but your story will carry weight.
