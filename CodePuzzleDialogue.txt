<p>You enter the Sublevel Listening Chamber. The walls hum with low, rhythmic whispers — echoes from the last shift of junior archivists. Someone has left playback logs open. You can choose from several voices:
[[Listen to Aria|ListenAria]]
[[Listen to Cora|ListenCora]]
[[Listen to Lia|ListenLia]]
[[Listen to Milo|ListenMilo]]
{(if: $heardAria is true and $heardCora is true and $heardLia is true and $heardMilo is true)[
You've heard enough whispers. Which terminal do you try?
[[Terminal A|TerminalA]]
[[Terminal B|TerminalB]]
[[Terminal C|TerminalC]]]
(else:)[
You must listen to all 4 voices before proceeding.

::ListenAria
(set: $ListenAria to true)

<p>Aria's voice crackles on the recording:
//If you knew the codes, you wouldn’t be asking. But fine. All I know is the real access key doesn’t include numbers. Someone told me it used a palindrome.//

[[Return to the voice recording menu|Puzzle1]]


::ListenCora
(set: $ListenCora to true)

<p>Cora clears her voice before beginning:
//If you knew the codes, you wouldn’t be asking. But fine. All I know is the real access key doesn’t include numbers. Someone told me it used a palindrome.//

[[Return to the voice recording menu|Puzzle1]]


::ListenLia
(set: $ListenLia to true)

<p>Lia's voice springs to life:
//If you knew the codes, you wouldn’t be asking. But fine. All I know is the real access key doesn’t include numbers. Someone told me it used a palindrome.//

[[Return to the voice recording menu|Puzzle1]]


::ListenMilo
(set: $ListenMilo to true)

<p>Milo rasps:
//If you knew the codes, you wouldn’t be asking. But fine. All I know is the real access key doesn’t include numbers. Someone told me it used a palindrome.//

::TerminalA
<p>You approach Terminal A. A message scrolls on-screen:
<div class="terminal">
(set: $typewriterText to "> ACCESS CODE: 1491FLEX-NOVA")
(display: "Typewriter")
</div>
The code is long and definitely not a palindrome. Try another terminal:
[[Terminal B|TerminalB]]
[[Terminal C|TerminalC]]


::TerminalB
<p>The screen on Terminal C flickers. You see garbled symbols and then static.</p>
<div class="terminal">
(set: $typewriterText to "> [ERROR 4568 :: DATA STREAM INTERRUPTED]")
(display: "Typewriter")
</div>
<p>No luck. [[Try Terminal C|TerminalC]]</p>


::TerminalC
<p>The screen glows softly:</p>
<div class="terminal">
(set: $typewriterText to "> ACCESS CODE: DEIFIED")
(display: "Typewriter")
</div>
<p><p>You blink. The word is the same forward and backward. You hit [["enter".|TerminalC.1]]</p>


::TerminalC.1
<div class="terminal">
(set: $typewriterText to "> SYSTEM: Valid palindrome confirmed. Access granted.")
(display: "Typewriter")
<p> **Success.** You lean in as a hidden directory opens beneath the main interface.
