<p>You are handed a thimble, three marbles, and a live beetle. A voice whispers:  //Stack them. Alphabetically.//
<br>
You succeed. Somehow.</p>

(set: $visited to $visited + 1)

<p>You must convince a velvet-robed llama to give you a spoon. You succeed by complimenting its hooves and reciting love poetry in iambic pentameter.</p>

::PerformanceTent
(set: $chaos to true)
(set: $visited to $visited + 1)

<p>You are thrown onto a stage lit by candles and rotating disco mushrooms.  A curtain lifts. A parrot heckles. You improvise a monologue about forks and regret. Applause erupts.</p>

[[Return to the Midway|HubVariable]]


::JobOffer
<p>You are summoned beneath the striped Job Pavilion. A panel of monocled toads evaluates your trials. One says, //Your trials are... inconclusive. Please return next carnival cycle for reevaluation.//
